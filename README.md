<h3>Hi there!👋</h3>

I'm Krish, a full-stack developer based in India.

I love building cool stuff, and backend is my place.

Outside of coding, you'll find me watching sports, hitting the gym, or doddling. I am interested in creating content and writing blogs, as well as sharing tech-related content on social media.

<h4>Fun Facts:</h4>
~ I won't respond to anyone if I'm watching F1 or Football.

~ I get excited about hearing new technologies.
